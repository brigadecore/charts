## This is the main configuration file for the Brigade chart.
## To override values here, specify them in your own YAML file, and override
## during install or upgrade:
##
##    $ helm install -n brigade -f myValues.yaml brigade/brigade
##
## By default, the chart will install with RBAC. To install without
## RBAC, set `rbac.enabled` to `false`.
##
## To enable the GitHub gateway, set `brigade-github-app.enabled` to `true`.
## See brigadecore/brigade-gitub-app for steps to setup a Github App and add its configuration
## to the sub-chart section below.
##
## Advanced Configuration
##
## Developers may wish to override the location of Docker images. For each
## deployment, `registry` controls the image registry, and `name` controls
## the image name. If unspecified, the Chart.yaml's appVersion field will be
## used to pull the tag. If you override the `tag` value, that version will
## be used instead.
##
## Note that when `rbac.enabled` is turned on, as is the default, the chart will
## install a set of RBAC objects that are designed to give a moderate set of
## permissions to the Brigade core components. However, even if RBACs are not
## enabled, this chart will create service accounts for each entity that we
## install. Security experts may prefer to apply their own RBACs instead of the
## ones supplied by the chart.  Provided that the service accounts remain the
## same, this chart should provide compatibility with custom rules.

## Kashti, the Brigade Dashboard, is enabled by default.
##
## These resources are included by way of a sub-chart dependency (see requirements.yaml)
##
## Further configurability of Kashti-specific values would also go here, e.g.
## kashti:
##   image:
##     repository: myrepository
##     ...
##
## For full configuration, see the kashti chart in this repository and its values.yaml.
kashti:
  enabled: true

## Brigade Github App, the GitHub Gateway for Brigade, is disabled by default.
##
## These resources are included by way of a sub-chart dependency (see requirements.yaml)
##
## Further configurability of Brigade Github App-specific values would also go here, e.g.
## brigade-github-app:
##   github:
##     appID: myGithubAppID
##     ...
##
## For full configuration, see the brigade-github-app chart in this repository
brigade-github-app:
  enabled: false
  github:
    ## Set a defaultSharedSecret if you want to use this one instance of the
    ## Github gateway with multiple Brigade projects. Leave the shared secret
    ## field blank in project-level configuration and this default will be used.
    # defaultSharedSecret:

## gw is the deprecated Oauth-based GitHub Gateway that shipped with Brigade <= v0.20
##
## Its alias has been preserved as `gw` to support legacy Brigade installations,
## although the chart name is `brigade-github-oauth`.
##
## We recommend users switch to the fully-supported Brigade GitHub App (configured above) instead.
##
## For full configuration, see the brigade-github-oauth chart in this repository
gw:
  enabled: false

## These values are for the Container Registry (CR) gateway.

## The vacuum periodically cleans up old builds.
## Brigade does not delete builds on completion. Instead, it leaves builds around
## for a period of time, providing you with an opportunity to inspect builds for
## data.
## The vacuum will sweep the system at intervals and clear out old builds.
##
## To globally turn of the vacuum, set enabled=false
vacuum:
  enabled: true
  ## Set a schedule for how frequently this check is run.
  ## Note that a run of the vacuum typically takes at least a minute. Finer-level
  ## granularity than that may result in multiple vacuums running at once.

  ## Age tells the vacuum how old a thing may be before it is considered ready to
  ## be vacuumed. The format is an integer followed by the suffix h (hours), m (minutes)
  ## or s (seconds).
  ## The default is 30 days (720 hours)
  age: "720h"
  ## maxBuilds tells the vacuum what the absolute maximum number of builds may be stored
  ## at a time. Where possible, we recommend using age rather than builds.
  ## -1 means no limit is imposed.

  ## If both age and maxBuilds are provided, age is applied first, then maxBuilds.
